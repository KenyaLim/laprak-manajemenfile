Load up on guns, bring your pals
It's fun to lose and to pretend
She's over bored and confident
Oh no, I know a dirty word

Hello, hello, hello, how low
Hello, hello, hello, how low
Hello, hello, hello, how low

With the lights off, it's less dangerous
Here we are now, entertain us
I feel dumb and contagious
Here we are now, entertain us
